# Music Data Platform

## Project Overview
This repository documents my hands-on journey building a data engineering platform using real-world music datasets. The focus is on practical pipelines, clean code organization, and reproducible environments.

## Goal
Design and implement an end-to-end data platform: ingest raw music data, transform it into structured models, and prepare it for analysis and reporting.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
- SQL
- (more tools will be added as the project evolves)

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → raw and processed datasets  
- `src/` → Python scripts and pipeline logic  
- `docs/` → notes and technical documentation  

## How to Run
Execution steps will be added as the project grows.
